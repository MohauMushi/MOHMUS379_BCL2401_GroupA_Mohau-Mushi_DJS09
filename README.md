# DJS09: Couch Surfing | Typescript Practice

## Project Overview

This project is a TypeScript implementation of a Couch Surfing website. It aims to provide a platform for travelers to find and book accommodations with hosts willing to offer their couches or spare rooms. The project was developed as part of a TypeScript learning exercise, focusing on understanding and applying TypeScript concepts.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
I gained valuable experience working with TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Interfaces:** Explored the use of interfaces to define the shape of objects, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to refactor
- **Classes and Inheritance:** Implemented classes and inheritance to create reusable code and understand how TypeScript handles object-oriented programming concepts
- **Generics:** Utilized generics to create reusable components that work with various data types, promoting code reusability and flexibility
- **Integration with Webpack:** Set up and configured Webpack to bundle TypeScript code, enabling the use of modern JavaScript features and optimizations

## Challenges

- **TypeScript Adoption:** It was challenging to adapt to TypeScript's syntax and concepts, especially coming from a JavaScript background. However, with practice and understanding the benefits of static typing, the transition will become smoother over time
